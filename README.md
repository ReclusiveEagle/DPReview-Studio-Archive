# DPReview-Studio-Archive
Archive of DPReview Studio comparison tool. Also includes ISO-invariance and Exposure latitude.

## URL Dump
Files are uploaded after I finish downloading all images.
### File Names
URL dump files are named by Camera manufacturer, whether it came from the RAW or JPEG drop down list, the lighting conditions, and any special camera modes such as super raw, multi-shot, pixel shift, etc.

### RAW
Includes all RAW and .ACR.JPEG files for all cameras at all ISO levels â€” .ACR.JPEG are Adobe Camera Raw JPEG exports.
These files are mostly unsorted. Camera and ISO metadata will be able to sort and catagorize these later, except for special camera modes. These require their own dedicated files for context as they risk being lost without separating them.

### To do:
- Finish scraping RAW day light
- Start scraping RAW low light
- Start scraping JPEG day light
- Start scraping JPEG low light
- Start scraping Exposure Latitude
- Start scraping ISO-Invariance

### Progress: 8%
