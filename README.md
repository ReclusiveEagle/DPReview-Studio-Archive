# DPReview-Studio-Archive
Archive of DPReview Studio comparison tool. Also includes ISO-invariance and Exposure latitude.

## URL Dump
Text files are uploaded as I finish downloading all images. Images will be uploaded as soon as as I have completed the archive download.
### File Names
Folders and URL dump.txt files are named by Camera manufacturer, whether it came from the RAW or JPEG drop down list, the lighting conditions, and any special camera modes such as super raw, multi-shot, pixel shift, etc. All images will retain their original file names.

### RAW
Includes all RAW and .ACR.JPEG files for all cameras at all ISO levels.
These files are mostly unsorted. Camera and ISO metadata will be able to sort and catagorize these later, except for special camera modes. These require their own dedicated files for context as they risk being lost without separating them. â€” *.ACR.JPEG are Adobe Camera Raw JPEG exports*
